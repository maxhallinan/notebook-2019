Guston syntax sketch:

```lisp
(= empty?
  (fn (x)
    (if (== '() x) 't '())))

(= rember
  (fn (x xs)
    (if (empty? xs) 
      xs 
      (if (== x (first xs)) 
        (rest xs)
        (::
          (first xs)
          (rember x (rest xs)))))))
```

```lisp
(= rember
  (fn (x xs)
    (if
      ((empty? xs) xs)
      (if
        ((== x (first xs)) (rest xs))
        (else
          (::
            (first xs)
            (rember x (rest xs))))))))

(= rember
  (fn (x xs)
    (oneof
      ((empty? xs) xs) 
      ((== x (first xs)) (rest xs)) 
      (::
        (first xs)
        (rember x (rest xs))))))

(= rember
  (fn (x xs)
    (if
      ((empty? xs) xs) 
      ((== x (first xs)) (rest xs)) 
      (::
        (first xs)
        (rember x (rest xs))))))
```
