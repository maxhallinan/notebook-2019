## Polynomial expressions and functions

**Polynomial**

A polynomial expression consists of

- Variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients
- Only the operations:
  - addition
  - subtraction
  - multiplication
  - non-negative integer exponents of variables

**Coefficient**

The multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial.
In the expression `2x + 1`, 2 is the coefficient of x.
Coefficients are often numbers but expressions can also be coefficients.

**Variable and Indeterminate**

These two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
When a polynomial is an expression, then `x` is an indeterminate because it is a
fixed symbol whose value is _indeterminate_.
When a polynomial is a function, then x is the argument of the function and is
called a variable.

**The degree of a polynomial**

The degree of a polynomial is the greatest exponent in the expression, ignoring
coefficients and constants.

The degree of `3x^2 + x + 33` is `2`.
The degree of `x^3 + x^2 + 4x + 11` is `3`.
The degree of `x^2 + x + 2^3` is `2`. It is not 3 because `2^3` is a constant.

**Standard form of a polynomial**

Standard form orders the terms by greatest to least degree.
`x^3 + x^2 + x + 3` is in standard form.
`x^2 + x^3 + x + 3` is not.
