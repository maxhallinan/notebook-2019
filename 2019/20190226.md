## i3 problem: backlight keys weren't working

Make sure xorg-xbacklight is installed.

Add these lines to ~/.config/i3/config:

```
# Sreen brightness controls
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -inc 10 # increase screen brightness
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -dec 10 # decrease screen brightness
```

After I did this, the backlight keys still weren't working.

When I tried to call xbacklight (e.g., `xbacklight -dec 40`), I got this error:
`No outputs have backlight property`

Checked that /sys/class/backlight existed.
Since it did, created this file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and added these lines:

```
Section "Device"
    Identifier "Intel Graphics"
    Driver "intel"
    Option "Backlight" "intel_backlight"
  EndSection
```

## i3 problem: remap caps lock to ctrl

Add `setxkbmap -option caps:ctrl_modifier` to ~/.profile.
~/.profile is a configuration file that is read on every login.

## i3 problem: how do I open programs like Firefox?

Run `$mod + d`.
This opens dmod.
Then start typing the name of the program and hit enter.

## i3 problem: disable touchpad tap-to-click

Add this to ~/.profile:

```
synclient TapButton1=0 TapButton2=0 TapButton3=0
```
