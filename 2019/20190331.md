## Radicle issue 29

[Github issue #29](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/issues/29)

Current lambda syntax:

```lisp
((fn [x y] (+ x y)) 1 2)
;; 3
```

Desired syntax:

```lisp
((fn args (first args)) 1 2 3)
;; Error using special form fn: First argument must be a vector of argument atoms.
;; src/Radicle/Internal/Eval.hs:66:20 throwErrorHere
;; Desired result is 1
```

[Here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/blob/master/src/Radicle/Internal/Eval.hs#L58-L68)
is where the argument is thrown.

Requirements:

- Should work for both a normal and a recursive lambda.

## PatternSynonyms GHC extension

[Documentation](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/pattern-synonyms)

A pattern synonym is an alias given to a pattern used in pattern matching.
This can make the pattern easier to read and write.

### Example 1

Representation of the typed of a program:

```haskell
type Type = App String [Type]
```

Here is a function that checks whether the type is an Int:

```haskell
isInt :: Type -> Bool
isInt (App "Int" []) = True
isInt _ = True
```

Here is a function that returns the type of the arguments to a function:

```haskell
getArgs :: Type -> [Type]
getArgs (App "->" [t1, t2]) = t1 : collectArgs t2
getArgs _ = []
```

This kind of pattern matching is hard to read and write.
The PatternSynonyms extensions gives a way to name patterns.

Using pattern synonyms makes the functions much cleaner:

```haskell
pattern Int = App "Int" []

isInt :: Type -> Bool
isInt Int = True
isInt _ = False
```

```haskell
pattern Arrow t1 t2 = App "->" [t1, t2]

getArgs :: Type -> [Type]
getArgs (Arrow t1 t2) = t2 : collectArgs t2
getArgs _ = []
```

### Example 2

Sum of products functors:

```haskell
newtype K a x = K a
newtype I x = I x
newtype (:+:) f g x = Sum (Either (f x) (g x))
newtype (:*:) f g x = Prod (f x, g x)
```

Recursive datatype:

```haskell
newtype Fix f = In (f (Fix f))

type Tree = Fix (K () :+: (I :*: I))
```

### Uni-directional synonyms

A uni-directional pattern synonym is one that is used only for pattern matching.

Here are the rules:

- Each of the variables on the left hand side must occur exactly once on the
  right hand side.
- The pattern synonym is not allowed to be recursive.

### Simply-bidirectional synonyms

A pattern synonym can be used as in an expression context wherever patterns are
valid as expressions.

### Syntax

- Each of the variables on the left hand side must occur exactly once on the
  right hand side.
- The pattern synonym is not allowed to be recursive.
- Export by prefixing the pattern identifier with `pattern`, e.g.
  `module Foo (pattern Bar) where`
- A data constructor and a pattern synonym can have the same identifier
- Pattern synonyms can have type signatures

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE PatternSynonyms #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-}

import qualified Data.Sequence as Seq

-- ViewPatterns is used here to do dynamic matching
-- then PatternSynonyms is used to create a "static" pattern out of this dynamic
-- check

-- call `viewl` on the value and then match with `EmptyL`
pattern Empty <- (Seq.viewl -> Seq.EmptyL)
-- call `viewl` on the value and then match with `:<`
pattern x :< xs <- (Seq.viewl -> x Seq.:< xs)
-- call `viewr` on the value and then match with `:>`
pattern xs :> x <- (Seq.viewr -> xs Seq.:> x)
```

#### Data.Sequence

The `Seq a` type represents a finite sequence of values of type `a`.
`Seq.viewl` takes a `Seq a` and returns a `ViewL a`.
Then `:<` can be called on the `ViewL a`.
`Seq.viewr` takes a `Seq a` and returns a `ViewR a`.
And then `:>` can be called on the `ViewR a`.
`x :< xs` exposes the left-most element of the sequence and the rest of the sequence.
`xs :> x` exposes the right-most element of the sequence and the rest of the sequence.
`EmptyL` is just an empty sequence.

## Sum of products

### Sum types

A union type is a sum type:
Called a sum type because the number of possible values is the sum of the values
that inhabit the type.
Here there are two possible values:

```haskell
data Foo = Bar | Baz
```

### Product types

A tuple is a product type:
The number of possible values is the product of the number of the values that
inhabit the underlying types.
Here there are four possible values:

```haskell
type Foo = (Bool, Bool)
```

## ViewPatterns GHC extension

[Documentation](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/view-patterns)

The motivation is that programmers tend to export the data constructors for a 
type because it makes pattern matching easier.
This extension provides the ergonomics of pattern matching without needing to 
export the data constructors.

A way to pattern match against values of abstract types.
An [abstract type](https://wiki.haskell.org/Abstract_data_type) is one where the
implementation is not exposed.
This is done via the module system; the data constructors are not exported.
In the case of Haskell, this means that you can't pattern match on the data
constructors.
You only have access to values of the type through functions.
So the module defines an API for interacting with the type and can change the
underlying representation without breaking code that consumes the type.
Parameterized types are also considered abstract because the full implementation
depends on concretizing the parameter.

The essence of `ViewPatterns` is that it adds an expression to pattern matching.
The expression must have a function type.
First, the expression is applied to the value that is being matched against.
Then the result of that expression is matched against the pattern.

```
expression -> pattern
```

- No new form of declaration (like the `pattern` declaration from `PatternSynonyms`)
- The view functions are ordinary Haskell functions

### Example 1

```haskell
-- the abstract type
type Typ

data TypView = Unit
             | Arrow Typ Typ

view :: Typ -> TypView

-- additional operations for constructing Typ's
```

The `view` function is called inside the pattern and the function result is
matched against.

```haskell
size (view -> Unit) = 1
size (view -> Arrow t1 t2) = size t1 + size t2
```

### Syntax notes

Variables bound to the left of view pattern expression are in scope for that 
expression:

```haskell
-- with ViewPatterns
foo :: (String -> Int) -> String -> String
-- `f` is called on the second argument
foo f (f -> 4) = "foo"
foo _ _ = "bar"

-- without ViewPatterns

foo :: (String -> Int) -> String -> Bool
foo f x = if f x == 4 then "foo" else "bar"
```

View patterns can be nested within the usual pattern matching syntax:

```haskell
foo :: (((String -> Int), Bool), String) -> String
foo ((f,_), f -> 4) = "foo"
foo _ = "bar"
```

## ViewPatterns and PatternSynonyms in the Radicle codebase

```haskell
pattern Lambda :: ValueConC t => [Ident] -> NonEmpty (Annotated t ValueF) -> Env (Annotated t ValueF) -> Annotated t ValueF           
pattern Lambda vs exps env <- (Ann.match -> LambdaF vs exps env)                                                                      
  where                                                                                                                             
  Lambda vs exps env = Ann.annotate $ LambdaF vs exps env                                                                           

-- First call `Ann.match` on the input 
-- Then check if the result is `LambdaF vs exps env`
-- If that matches, `vs`, `exps`, and `env` are bound to the scope
-- Then the where clause is evaluated
-- Weirdly, I think this where clause itself uses the PatternSynonym
```
