- recursive patterns
    - design a grammar notation like EBNF
    - exercises where i give examples of a string and the student must write the
      grammar for those strings
    - highlight what part of the string is matched by the grammar
    - when i was explaining recursion to teresa, i used the example of the name GNU
    - i think that string patterns are perhaps the most familiar example of recursion
    - will require the student to write recursive grammars
    - must be able to handle left-recursive grammars
    - i want to emphasize the idea of substitution
    - substitution is the fundamental intuition that i want to give the reader.
      it's not about iteration or repetition or looping
    - recursion is something that is defined in terms of itself
    - you think of recursion by "evaluating" recursive expressions
    - evaluating is about substituting an expression with another expression or a value
- recursive data
    - this will build on recursive patterns
    - recursive data/types will feel very similar to recursive grammars
- recursive functions
    - the intuition about substitution works here because of referential transparency
      `fib 5 == [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`
    - recursive functions should be understood as another kind of pattern
      - that they're "callable" shouldn't be a fundamental part of the intuition
      - you can use the same way of reasoning about recursive patterns and recursive data
        to write recursive functions
