One problem with The Little Schemer in the first chapter: I started playing with
the examples in the Racket REPL.
I keep getting `application: not a procedure` errors.
I don't know what this means.
The book hasn't given me enough introduction to the syntax to know how to debug
this.

A second, related problem: it's unclear to me what the difference between an 
S-expression and a list is.

What is an S-expression:

- an atom is an S-expression
- a list is an S-expression
- is everything an S-expression?

Even if I write `(1 2 3)` in the Racket REPL, I get 
`application: not a procedure`.
Perhaps this is something about the REPL.
In Haskell's REPL, I can enter a list literal, hit enter, and the list is 
printed below.
Maybe Racket's REPL treats everything as function application?

I was also confused by the answer to this question: "How many S-expressions are 
in the list? (((how) are) ((doing) (so)) far)"
The answer is 3.
I would have expected each recursive level to be counted.
