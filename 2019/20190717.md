## Lisp stepper

### Problem: saving the intermediate histories 

My initial thought was to do something like this:

```purescript
worker x = do
  r <- eval x
  pure $ History { result: r, history: x }
```

This doesn't work because the types don't match.

```purescript
x :: Compose E.ExprAnnF E.ExprF (Attr ...)

type Expr = Mu (Compose E.ExprAnnF E.ExprF)

eval :: E.Expr -> Eval E.Expr
```

I need to convert `x` to `Expr`.

```purescript
{ result :: E.Expr
, history :: Compose E.ExprAnnF E.ExprF (History (Compose E.ExprAnnF E.ExprF) E.Expr)
}

History (Compose E.ExprAnnF E.ExprF) E.Expr
```

### Problem: intermediate `Eval` effects

If I just return the `Attr` produced by `histo`, then I have this:

```purescript
Attr { attribute :: Eval Expr, hole :: Compose ExprAnnF ExprF (Attr (Compose ExprAnnF ExprF) (Eval Expr) }
```

In order to see what `attribute` is at each step, I need to actually run the 
`Eval` effect for each `attribute`, as I do with `runProgram`.
That means traversing the entire `Attr` tree with something like `runProgram`, 
going from `Eval Expr` to `Either EvalErr Expr`.
I thought I could avoid this with something like this: 

```purescript
foo expr do
  e <- eval expr
  pure { result: e, history: x }
```

The idea is to use `do` notation to string along each intermittent call to `eval`
so that I get a `Eval (Attr ...)` instead of `Attr (...) (Eval ...)`.
The problem with this is that evaluation will stop at the point where an error
is produced. 
I don't want this to happen.
So I need to take the first approach: make a tree of `Eval` effects, then 
traverse the tree applying something like `runProgram` to each effect.
