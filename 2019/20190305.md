## Architecture for face-invaders

These are the states:

- Start
- Play
- Pause
- End

Each state has 

- view
- update
- subscriptions
- model?

Differences:

- view
  - the screen is the same for each but could change
  - the help text is different for each screen

- subscriptions
  - Start, Pause, and End all just subscribe to the Enter key press
  - Play has more subscriptions

- update
  - Each state has its own update loop

- They kind of all share a model
- The Game model remains in the global model because it's just being used as the
  screen for all of them
- It would be nice not to have to case on the State all the time

- I'm casing in each of the message handlers and each of the subscriptions 
function

```elm
Game.Play.update msg model.game
Game.Play.subscriptions 
Game.Start.subscriptions 
Game.Stop.subscriptions 

toMsg : Global.Msg -> Maybe Msg 
toMsg msg =
  case msg of
    Global.KeyUp Enter ->
      Just <| KeyUp Enter

    _ ->
      Nothing
```

All the events are coming from the subscriptions.

Problems:

- each of these modules have to communicate with the top layer.
- for example, Game.Play needs to be able to tell the top layer that the game is
over. then the top layer switches the state to `End`.
so you need global messages and global subscriptions.
- it can request a state change but how does it know which state?
- there's a global event bus
- maybe there's one module that knows all of the states.
- the Game module
- Game manages the subscriptions, the game states, the key events, etc.
- then it maps these to smaller msg/update cycles
- So only Game.Play knows if the game is over but only the higher level has the 
power to change the game state.
Could create a two-way message system.
- Maybe each sub-module has its own messages that it can pass up

```elm
-- Game.Start
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Maybe Event)

subscriptions : Sub Msg

type Model = ()

type Msg = KeyUp  Key

type Key = Enter | Other

type Event = GameStart
```

```elm
-- Game.Pause
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Maybe Event)

subscriptions : Sub Msg

type Model = ()

type Msg = KeyUp  Key

type Key = Enter | Other

type Event = Unpause
```

```elm
-- Game.End
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Maybe Event)

subscriptions : Sub Msg

type Model = ()

type Msg = KeyUp Key

type Key = Enter | Other

type Event = Restart
```

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Maybe Event)

subscriptions : Sub Msg

type Model = { hand : Hand, bullets : List Bullet, faces : Grid Face }

type Msg 
  = KeyUp Key
  | KeyDown Key
  | Tick Float
  | DiceRoll Int

type Key = Left | Right | Enter | Space | Other

type Event = Pause | GameOver
```
