## Writing a Lisp standard library

There are three kinds of Lisp functions:

- Special forms
  - Require non-standard evaluation of arguments
  - Must be implemented in the compiler/interpreter
- Primitives
  - Primitive function calls are mapped to operators in the host language
  - e.g. integer math
  - Must be implemented in the compiler/interpreter
- All other functions
  - Any function that isn't a special form or a primitive should be implemented
    natively and exposed through a standard library.

`cdr` and `car` are special forms because they must except S-expressions without
evaluating the arguments.

**Questions**

- Why are `cdr` and `car` special forms? It looks like the arguments _are_ 
  evaluated.

High-level approach to evaluating with a standard library:

1. Define the standard library
1. Define a function like `evalWithStdLib`
  - This function takes an filepath to the standard lib file and a lisp string
  - Reads the file and prepends contents to the lisp string
  - Parses and evaluates the file
  - I wonder if there's a more efficient way to do this.
  - I don't want the standard lib to be read in and parsed for every REPL loop.

## Testing a Lisp interpreter

- Use hspec for unit tests
- Use tasty-golden for end-to-end tests

### Tasty Golden tests

`Test.Tasty.Golden` is for comparing a given file or string to the contents of a
"golden" file.
The golden file represents the correct result.
