## Project proposal for my Recurse Center batch

Aim: 
The purpose of this project is to establish a solid grounding in computer
science.
I want to become a stronger programmer.
My understanding of programming is based on what I've had to learn to do web
development.
I want to establish a broader foundational understanding of computer science.
Because I did not study computer science in college, I am missing a foundation
in the fundamentals of computer science.

Goals:

- Read the entire book
- Do all of the exercises and post to a Github repo
- Write a blog post summarizing each section

Project: work through _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.

Sections: ~2 a week (22 / 10)
Pages: ~18 per day, (853 pages / 50 days)
Exercises: ~8 per day, (356 / 50)
