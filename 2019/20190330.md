## Radicle local development

Problems I've encountered:

- tests throw an error if stylish-haskell is not installed

## Radicle issue #325

Problem:

- When the file contains a shebang, the error line number is off by one
- This is because the shebang is removed before the file is parsed

Observations:

The shebang is removed by this function here: [`ignoreShebang`](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/blob/021b748969230d06ac23c3ce5a0a36bcef0c582b/src/Radicle/Internal/Effects.hs#L371).

Solution: 

Replace the shebang line with a newline.

## Radicle issue #274

Problem:

- radicle's run-test function does not catch exceptions thrown during
  evaluation of the test. 
- The test should fail with the exception message instead of crashing.

`run-test` is implemented [here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/blob/master/rad/prelude/test.rad#L116-L132).

Observations:

- If I run a test with `prelude/test/run-all`, then the exception is caught 
  and printed, and the rest of the tests run.
- If I run the same test with `prelude/test/run-test`, then the exception 
  crashes the test.
- This is weird because `run-all` calls `run-test`.

Solution: 

I think this problem is already fixed, as I described 
[here](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle/issues/274#issuecomment-478247647).

## Writing radicle tests

Here is a very basic test:

```lisp
;; load prelude
(load! (find-module-file! "prelude.rad"))
;; load the test library
(import prelude/test)

;; A collection of tests 
;; This is updated by the `:test` macro
(def tests (ref []))

;; Create a test
(:test "#t is equal to #t" 
  ;; a test has one or more "steps"
  ;; each step is a vector triple where the second item is the ==> symbol
  ;; the first expression in the step is evaluated
  ;; the evaluated first expression is compared to the third item
  ;; *the third item is not evaluated*
  [(eq? #t #t) ==> #t])

;; run-all runs the tests and logs the result
(prelude/test/run-all (read-ref tests))
```
