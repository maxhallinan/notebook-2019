Questions:

- What's the difference between Haskell and Lisp?
  Not the technical differences but the differences in how an idea is expressed
  in both languages, e.g. implement the same function.
- What are the foundations of Lisp?
  Not just the original special forms and the eval function, but the conceptual
  foundations.
    - everything is a list
    - everything is an expression
    - recursion
    - conditional expressions
    - partial functions
- What are the foundations of Haskell?

```haskell
rember :: a -> [a] -> [a]
rember _ [] = []
rember x (y:ys) 
  | x == y = ys 
  | otherwise = (y : rember x ys)
```

In Gustons paintings, you find these vast collections of things.
The same things keep reappearing in different paintings.
He has an alphabet of symbols and he combines and recombines these symbols in 
different ways.
With a small alphabet, he creates a seemingly endless world.
And though these symbols are all different, distinct, well-defined within the 
space they occupy, easily distinguished, they at the same time all seem to be
made out of the same stuff.
That is Lisp.
