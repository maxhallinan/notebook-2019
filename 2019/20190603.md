## PureScript's Eff Monad

> the monad of extensible effects

```purescript
forall eff. Eff (console :: CONSOLE, random :: RANDOM | eff) Unit
```

This is a type for a computation that supports console IO (`CONSOLE`), 
random number generation (`RANDOM`), and any other effects (`eff`).
This computation evaluates to type `Unit`.

Extensible refers to the set of possible side-effects.
The set can always be extended, as long as the added effects are supported by
the environment.

### Interleaving effects

```purescript
main :: forall eff. Eff (console :: CONSOLE, random :: RANDOM | eff) Unit

random :: forall eff1. Eff (random :: RANDOM | eff1) Number

logShow :: forall eff2. Show a => a -> Eff (console :: CONSOLE | eff2) Unit
```

`eff1` and `eff2` can be specialized to match the type of `main`.
That's why a do-block can use both without having to lift, as one does with 
Haskell.
This is called interleaving.

> The point is that the types of random and logShow indicate the side-effects 
> which they contain, but in such a way that other side-effects can be mixed-in, 
> to build larger computations with larger sets of side-effects.

### The Kind of Eff

```
> :kind Eff
# Control.Monad.Eff.Effect -> Type -> Type

> :kind CONSOLE
Control.Monad.Eff.Effect

> :kind RANDOM
Control.Monad.Eff.Effect
```

`Control.Monad.Eff.Effect` is a kind.
`#` is a kind constructor.
`# Control.Monad.Eff.Effect` is the kind of effects.
Effects are type-level labels for side-effects.
