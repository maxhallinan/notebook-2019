## How does `cataM` work?

```purescript
cataM :: forall t f m a. Recursive t f => Monad m => Traversable f => AlgebraM m f a -> t -> m a
cataM f = go
  where go t = f =<< traverse go (project t)
```

1. first discard the outer structure `t`
2. this gives you `f t`.
3. traverse is `traverse :: forall f m a. Applicative m => Traversable f => (a -> m b) -> f a ->  m (f b)`
4. so the `f t` from `project` is second argument to traverse. 
5. the first argument is `a -> m b`, is go, which has type `t -> m a`
6. the difference is really just that cata uses `map` to lift `go` over all these layers of `f`.
7. cataM uses traverse because there's an intermediate level of monad
8. i was trying to apply `f` to `m (f b)`, that's why you need `bind`, because f is `f a -> m a`
   and `bind` is `m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b`.

## Abstract definitional interpreters

Recursive code, such as traditional evaluators, can be rewritten to inject new
behavior at each layer of the recursion.
