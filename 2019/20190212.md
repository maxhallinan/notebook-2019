## Guston syntax sketches

Guston syntax sketch

```
(= null?
  (fn (xs)
    (== xs (quote ()))))

(= lat?
  (fn (xs)
    (if (null? xs)
      (quote t)
      (if (atom? (first xs))
        (lat? (rest xs))
        (quote ())))))

(lat? (quote (a b c)))
; t

(= member?
  (fn (x xs)
    (if (null? xs)
      (quote t)
      (if (== x (first xs))
        (quote t)
        (member? x (rest xs))))))

(member? (quote c) (quote (a b c)))
; t

(= rember
  (fn (x xs)
    (if (null? xs)
      xs
      (if (== x (first xs))
        (rest xs)
        (::
          (first xs)
          (rember x (rest xs)))))))

(rember (quote b) (quote (a b c)))
; (a c)
```

Syntax sketch for typed Guston

```
(type (-> (List a) Bool)
  (= null?
    (fn (xs)
      (== xs (quote ())))))

(type (-> (List a) Bool)
  (= lat?
    (fn (xs)
      (if (null? xs)
        (quote t)
        (if (atom? (first xs))
          (lat? (rest xs))
          (quote ()))))))

(type (Bool)
  lat? (quote (a b c))))
```

## Lisp error message

I want the interpeter to show each evaluation step in an error message.

Here is a simple example of evaluation steps:

```
(:: (quote x) (quote ()))
(:: x (quote ()))
(:: x ())
(x)
```

Here is an example where it finds an error:

```
(:: (quote x) (first (quote (y))))
(:: x (first (quote (y))))
(:: x (first (y)))
(:: x y)
wrong type
```

Each line prints the current state of the AST.

What do I get if I print each expression evaled by `eval`?

```
(:: (quote x) (first (quote (y))))
(quote x)
(first (quote (y)))
(quote (y))
wrong type
```

There are a few problems:

- When `eval` is called on each subexpression, I lose the context of the parent
  expression.
- I need a way to stick each evaluated expression back into the AST.
- zippers?

What do I know?

- I know how to print a Guston AST
- I know how to update state during evaluation
- I know the location information

What don't I know?

- I don't know how to replace an unevaluated subtree of the AST with it's 
  evaluated value
- I don't know how to find the node I am evaluating in the tree from within the 
  eval function
- I don't know how to clone the tree during each iteration
- I don't know how many of these iterations I should print

Maybe a zipper is the tool for this problem.
