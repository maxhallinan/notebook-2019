## Sourcegraph line number search

- requires changes to indexed and non-indexed search code paths
  - indexed: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/textsearch.go#L832:31
  - non-indexed: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/textsearch.go#L797:48

steps:

1. [x] remove `:123` as a pre-processing step
1. [x] get the line number
1. remove all results with line matches
1. the remaining results are filematches
1. insert a synthetic line match
1. either:
  - fetch content of file at line to populate preview
  - leave the preview empty and update the frontend code

questions:

- what argument to searchFilesInRepos is the query string?
- where should i strip off the `:123` pattern?

`searchFilesInRepos` gets a second argument `args`.
`args` is an Arg, a struct that includes a field `Pattern`.
"Args are the arguments passed to a search backend. It contains the Pattern to 
search for, as well as the hydrated list of repository revisions to search."
`Pattern` has type `*PatternInfo`, which is a pointer to PatternInfo
`PatternInfo` is also a struct, defined in the search package.
"PatternInfo is the struct used by vscode pass on search queries. Keep it in sync
with pkg/searcher/protocol.PatternInfo"
PatternInfo contains these fields:

```go
struct {
  Pattern: string
  IsRegExpr: bool
  IsWordMatch: bool
  IsCaseSensitive: bool
  FileMatchLimit: bool
  IncludePattern: string
  IncludePatterns: []string
  ExcludePattern: string
  PathPatternsAreRegExps: bool
  PathPatternsAreCaseSensitive: bool
  PatternMatchesContent: bool
  PatternMatchesPath: bool
}
```

`Args` also contains a Query field which is a pointer to a query.Query

notes:

- when i do a bare search for `filename:100`, i get a syntax error: `"Type error at character 38: unrecognized field "syntax"`
- if i do a search for `filename.ext:100`, i get `"No results"`
- if i do a search for `file:filename:100`, i get `"No results"`
