Approach:

1. modify two places:
 - indexed search code path: cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/textsearch.go:832
 - non-indexed search code path: cmd/frontend/graphqlbackend/textsearch.go:L797
1. find line number in `args.Pattern.Pattern`
1. remove `:\d+$` from from `args.Pattern.Pattern`
1. backend: create a synthetic line match
  - condition:
    - line number is found
    - only one file match
    - no line matches on the file match
  - line match
    - JPreview
    - JOffsetAndLengths
    - JLineNumber
    - JLimitHit: `false`
1. frontend: components/FileMatch
  - if the number of line matches is 1, then link directly to the line and show 
    `:<line number>` in file name

questions:
  - how do i fetch the file for preview
  - how do i find the correct offset and length?
  - why is the line number off by one in the highlighted preview?
