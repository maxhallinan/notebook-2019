## [WYaS2: Error Checking and Exceptions](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/04_errors.html)

**Errors versus Exceptions**

An error is a situation that's unexpected or unknown problems.
A program cannot recover from an error; the program itself must be modified.

An exception is a foreseen or expected problem, often a user error.

Wespiser's Scheme interpreter has three categories of exception:

- Parsing
- Evaluation
- IO

Questions:

- How can I throw an exception that isn't in the return type?
  - Specifically in the implementation of [`slurp`](https://github.com/write-you-a-scheme-v2/scheme/blob/master/src/Prim.hs#L67-L73)
    - `readTextFile` [throws](https://github.com/write-you-a-scheme-v2/scheme/blob/master/src/Prim.hs#L85-L90) 
      a `LispException`
    - I thought that the context had to be `Eval` to throw a `LispException`.
    - But I guess throw delegates to the IO context and when I call liftIO on 
      that monad, then the error is lifted into `Eval`.
    - I should look into how this is all implemented.

- Worked through [Chapter 4](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/04_errors.html) 
  and [Chapter 5](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/05_primitives.html) of Adam
