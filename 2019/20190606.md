## How is apply defined for Free?

I've been working on defining the Apply instance for Free.
This means defining `apply`.
Again, this was tricky.
Typed holes were really helpful here.
Typed holes give you types for values in the context.
By looking at those types, I could start to see what operations I needed.

Another interesting "discovery" or new intuition I had to day is that you can use
`map` to lift a function into a context.
I developed this intuition while I was working on lift2.
`lift2` is sort of like map, in that it takes a function and lifts it over some
structure, preserving the structure.
But it is also like apply.
Initially I thought I could do something like this:

```purescript
lift2 :: forall f a b c. (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
lift2 f a b = apply (\x -> apply (f x) b) a
```

This doesn't work for two reasons.
First, apply is `apply :: forall f a b. Apply f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`.
The argument to the outer apply is just a function, it's not an `f` of a 
function.

Why does this work:

```purescript
apply (Free k) x = Free $ map (_ `apply` x) k
-- or
apply (Free f) x = Free $ map (\g -> apply g x) f
```

but this does not work:

```purescript
apply (Free k) x = Free $ map (apply k) x
-- or
apply (Free f) x = Free $ map (\y -> apply f y) x
```

Evaluation steps:

Works:

```purescript
apply (Free k) x = Free $ map (_ `apply` x) k

apply (Free (Just (Pure not))) (Pure true) 
Free $ map (\g -> apply g x) (Just (Pure not))
Free $ Just $ apply (Pure not) (Pure true)
Free $ Just $ Pure $ not true
Free $ Just $ Pure $ false
Free $ Just $ Pure false
Free $ Just (Pure false)
Free (Just (Pure false))
```

```purescript
apply (Free f) x = Free $ map (\y -> apply f y) x

apply (Free (Just (Pure not))) (Pure true) 
Free $ map (\y -> apply f y) (Pure true)
Free $ Pure (\y -> apply f y) (Pure true) 
-- Here is a problem. `Free $ Pure` is not correct. There should be a Maybe 
-- value in there.
```

What if I remove the outer layer of `Free`?

```purescript
apply (Free f) x = map (\y -> apply f y) x

apply (Free (Just (Pure not))) (Pure true) 
map (\y -> apply f y) (Pure true)
Pure $ apply (Just (Pure not)) true
-- this also doesn't work because true should be wrapped in an instance of Apply
```

```purescript
apply (Free f) x = map (\y -> apply f y) x

apply (Free (Just (Pure not))) (Free (Just (Pure true)))
map (\y -> apply f y) (Free (Just (Pure true)))
Free $ apply (Just (Pure not)) (Just (Pure true))
Free $ Just $ (Pure not) (Pure true)
-- this also doesn't work. it's trying to apply a Free to a Free, because it
-- expects the first value to be a function.
```

This expected was what I came up with in the beginning to handle one of 
the cases.
This approach only works if the second argument is `Pure`.

```purescript
apply (Free k) (Pure x) = Free $ map (\g -> apply g (Pure x)) k
```

## How is bind defined for Free?

```purescript
foo :: Bool -> Free Maybe Bool
foo x = Pure (not x)

bind (Pure true) foo
foo true
Pure (not true)
Pure false

bind (Free (Just (Pure true))) foo
Free $ (bind >>> bind) (Just (Pure true)) foo 
Free $ ()
-- That won't work because foo will return (Pure $ not true) which will end up 
-- being (Free (Pure false)).

bind (Free (Just (Pure true))) foo
bind (Just (Pure true)) (_ `bind` foo)
bind (_ `bind` foo)
-- This doesn't work because the function to Bool needs to return a `Maybe b`
```

```purescript
bind (Free x) f = Free $ map (bind f) x

bind (Free (Just (Pure true))) foo
Free $ map (bind f) (Just (Pure true))
Free $ Just $ bind f (Pure true)
-- here is the problem. the arguments are mixed up.
-- `bind f (Pure true)` should be `bind (Pure true) f`
```

Here it is:

```purescript
bind (Free x) f = Free $ map (_ `bind` f) x

bind (Free (Just (Pure true))) foo
Free $ map (_ `bind` f) (Just (Pure true))
Free $ Just $ (Pure true) `bind` foo
Free $ Just $ Pure (not true)
Free $ Just $ Pure false
Free $ Just (Pure false)
Free (Just (Pure false))
```

So again, you have to use `map` to lift over structure.
`map` is really helpful for that. 
When you want to lift a function over some structure and you want to preserve
that structure.
Any time you're doing something where you're like "yeah, just ignore whatever 
that structure is. I'm trying to do something to whatever is inside that 
structure without changing the structure in any way. 
I don't want to have to think about that structure at all."
Then use `map`.

**Questions**

- Why does apply of `Free` and `Pure` always return Free?
