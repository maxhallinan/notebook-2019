## Pathy

Distinguishes between relative and absolute paths.
Distinguishes between directories and file names.
These distinctions prevent you from using some kinds of paths where those paths
don't make sense.
For example, you couldn't construct a path `<currentdir>/<rootdir>`.

**`Path`**

The `Path` type is the single abstraction over all of these distinctions.
`Path` is a phantom type.
The first parameter can be `Abs` or `Rel`, and the second parameter can be `Dir`
or `File`.

```purescript
data Path (a :: RelOrAbs) (b :: DirOrFile)
  = Init
  | ParentOf (Path Rel Dir)
  | In (Path a Dir) (Name b)
```

**Building path literals**

- `rootDir`: the root directory of an absolute path
- `currentDir`: the current director
- `file`: a file, including extension, in the current directory
- `dir`: a directory (in the current directory)
- `</>`: adds a relative path to the end of a path (relative or absolute)
- `<.>`: sets the extension of a file path
- `<..>`: ascends one level and the descends into the following relative path

```purescript
path = rootDir
  </> dir (SProxy :: SProxy "foo")
  </> dir (SProxy :: SProxy "bar")
  </> file (SProxy "baz.txt")
```

**Parsing path strings**

The way to parse a path string is to use `parsePath`.
`parsePath` requires you to handle these cases:

```purescript
parsePath 
  :: forall z
   . Parser 
  -> (RelDir -> z) 
  -> (AbsDir -> z) 
  -> (RelFile -> z)
  -> (AbsFile -> z)
  -> z 
  -> String
  -> z
```

- `Path Rel File`
- `Path Abs File`
- `Path Rel Dir`
- `Path Abs Dir`

I didn't know you could add a type annotation to the type parameter of a type
constructor.
That's pretty interesting.
Oh interesting, `RelOrAbs` and `DirOrFile` are kinds, not types.

**Things to look up**

- Kinds versus types - how that works.
- What is `SProxy`?

## Golden testing library API

1. Two files
  - source file
  - answer file

1. Read in source file.
1. Eval source file.
1. Compare eval result to the answer file.
1. If the answer file doesn't exist:
  - Create answer file.
  - Write result to answer file.

Using the library:

1. Get file paths.
1. Use file paths to get files.
1. `runTest` over each of the files.
  1. Read file path

### API

Haskell's golden testing library is [`tasty-golden`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-golden-2.3.2/docs/Test-Tasty-Golden.html).
[Tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty-1.1.0.1) is a testing framework.
What is tasty-golden responsible for?
So presumably I can extend `purescript-spec` with a golden testing module.
How can I do this?

```haskell
-- tasty-golden
goldenVsFile
  :: TestName -- (String) the name of the test
  -> FilePath -- path to the <<golden>> file
  -> FilePath -- path to the output file
  -> IO () -- action that creates the output file
  -> TestTree -- the test that verifies that the output file and the golden file are equal

goldenVsString
  :: TestName -- (String) the name of the test
  -> FilePath -- path to the <<golden>> file
  -> IO ByteString -- string to compare the golden file to
  -> TestTree -- the test that verifies that the output file and the golden file are equal

-- golden
defaultMain :: TestTree -> IO ()
```

1. I should be able to read the files in.
2. Compare the two files.
3. Return an assertion of equality.

I need to go from `Array (Spec Unit) -> Spec Unit`.
I mean, describe already does this:

```
describe :: String -> Spec Unit -> Spec Unit
it :: String -> Aff Unit -> Spec Unit
Spec :: State (Array (Group (Aff Unit))) t
traverse :: forall a b m. Applicative m => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)
traverse :: (String -> Aff (Spec Unit)) ->  Array String -> Aff (Array (Spec Unit))
sequence :: forall a m. Applicative m => t (m a) -> m (t a)
sequence :: Array (Spec Unit) -> Spec (Array Unit)

describe "a group of tests" do
  it "should do this" $ shouldEqual true true
  it "should do that" $ shouldEqual true true

-- desugars to

it "should do this" $ shouldEqual true true
  >>= it "should do that" $ shouldEqual true true
```
