## [24 Days of PureScript: Generic Deriving](https://github.com/paf31/24-days-of-purescript-2016/blob/master/11.markdown)

Generic programming is a way to avoid boilerplate code.
The implementation of functions are inferred by the shape of the types involved.

PureScript originally used the [purescript-generics](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-generics/4.0.0)
library for generic programming.

PureScript generics are based on this class.
The methods of this class attempt to convert to and from this representation.

```haskell
class Generic a where
  toSpine :: a -> GenericSpine
  fromSpine :: GenericSpine -> Maybe a
  toSignature :: Proxy a -> GenericSignature
```

Haskell uses associated types for generic instances.
PureScript uses functional dependencies (which I still don't understand).

```haskell
class Generic a rep | a -> rep where
  from :: a -> rep
  to :: rep -> a
```

The functional dependency tells the compiler that if you know the type `a`, then
you can infer the type `rep`.

### (Cooking Classes with Datatype Generic Programming)[http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/generics.html]

Generic programming translates a specific datatype into a generic representation
of that datatype.

### Sum of products

All Haskell datatypes can be represented as a sum of products.

Sum type:

```haskell
data Pastry 
  = Turnover
  | Macaroon
  | Brownie
  | Cookie
```

Product type:

```haskell
data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int 
                     }
```

Sum of products:

```haskell
data Expr  
  = Add { l :: Expr, r :: Expr }
  | Sub { l :: Expr, r :: Expr }
  | Mult { l :: Expr, r :: Expr }
  | Div { l :: Expr, r :: Expr }
  | Num Int
```

During compilation, most of the information about the structure of the datatypes
is thrown out.
All type-level info is removed.
The named record fields are moved to the module's top level and expanded into
functions.

Generic programming makes use of this type level info.

### Type families

Type families enable you to associate a datatype with a typeclass.

```haskell
class Generic a where type Rep a :: * -> *
  from :: a -> (Rep a) x
  to :: (Rep a) x -> a
```

```haskell
-- Empty
data V1 p

-- Unit
data U1 p = U1

-- Sum
data (:+:) f g p = L1 (f p) | R1 (g p)

-- Product
data (:*:) f g p = (f p) :*: (g p)

-- Container for a c
newtype K1 i c p = K1 { unK1 :: c }

-- Metadata wrapper
newtype M1 i t f p = M1 { unM1 :: f p }
```

```haskell
data Ingredient 
  = Flour
  | Sugar

instance Generic Ingredient where
  type Rep Ingredient = M1 D (T_Ingredient ((M1 C (C_Flour U1))) :+: (M1 C (C_Sugar U1)))

  from Flour = M1 (L1 (M1 U1))
  from Sugar = M1 (R1 (M1 U1))

  to (M1 (L1 (M1 U1))) = Flour
  to (M1 (R1 (M1 U1))) = Sugar

data T_Ingredient
data C_Flour
data C_Sugar
```

Where did `C` and `D` come from?
