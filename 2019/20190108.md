## `Control.Monad.Except`

This module is not related to `Exception`, `SomeException`, and `catch`.
Those values are built into GHC and are mostly used within the IO monad.
`Control.Monad.Except` is used to define a new kind of exception control 
mechanism.
None of the "catching" mechanisms from `Control.Monad.Except` will catch an 
exception related to `Control.Exception`.

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadError e m | m -> e where 
  throwError :: e -> m a
  catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a
```

This type signature says two things:

1. It's using the `MultiParamTypeClasses` extension.
  - `e` and `m` are two parameters to one type class.
2. It's using the `FunctionalDependencies` extension.
  - `| m -> e` says that the type of `m` determines the type of `e`.
  - There can only be one type `e` for any one type `m`.
  - So for every type `m` in an instance of `MonadError`, there is a unique type 
    `e`.

Example use:

```haskell
data LengthError 
  = EmptyString
  | StringTooLong Int
  | OtherError String
  deriving Show

type LengthMonad = Either LengthError

main = do
  putStrLn "please enter a string" 
  s <- getLine
  reportResult (calculateLength s)

calculateLength :: Strength -> LengthMonad Int
calculateLength [] = throwError EmptyString
calculateLength s | len > 5   = throwError (StringToLong len)
                  | otherwise = return len
  where len = length s

reportResult :: LengthMonad Int -> IO ()
reportResult (Left err)   = putStrLn $ "Error: " ++ show err
reportResult (Right len)  = putStrLn $ show len
```

### Functional dependencies

> Used to constrain the parameters of a type class.

- given a multi-parameter type class
- one of the parameters can be determined by the other
- the parameter determined by the others can then be constrained in the class 
  operations

Example from [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_dependencies):

> `| container -> elem` promises that we won't declare multiple instances with
> the same `container` type.

```haskell
class Extract container elem | container -> elem where
  extract :: container -> elem
```

Could have more than one instance with the same type of container:

```haskell
instance Extract (a, b) a where
  extract (x, _) = x

instance Extract (a, b) b where
  extract (_, x) = x
```

Then the return type of `extract` is ambiguous.

```haskell
foo = extract (1, 'a')
```

Is `Int` or `Char` the type of `foo`?

This can happen with any multi-parameter type class.
Isn't this true for _all_ multi-parameter type classes?
Why isn't this the behavior of the `MultiParamTypeClasses` extension?
