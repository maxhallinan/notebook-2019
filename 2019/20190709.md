```elm
type ExprF a 
  = SFrm SFrm
  | Sym String
  | Lst (List a)
  | Fn Env (List a) a

type ExprAnn =
  ExprAnn 
    { step : Int
    , expr : Maybe (ExprF ExprAnn)
    }
```

This doesn't work because I lose some information.
When `ExprF` is parameterized that way, then you can only get the annotation
information on constructors that have a parameter `a`.

Where do I want the annotation information?
For the beginning, I could just put it on lists.

```elm
type Expr 
  = SFrm SFrm
  | Sym String
  | Lst (List Expr) (Maybe Histo)
  | Fn Env (List Expr) Expr

type Histo = 
  Histo { step : Int
        , result : Result EvalErr Expr
        }
```

What does the annotation have in it?
The problem with this approach is that I only then get a result on the `Lst` 
node.
That means every node has to have an annotation.

```elm
type Expr 
  = SFrm SFrm (Maybe Histo)
  | Sym String (Maybe Histo)
  | Lst (List Expr) (Maybe Histo)
  | Fn Env (List Expr) Expr (Maybe Histo)

type Histo = 
  Histo { step : Int
        , result : Result EvalErr Expr
        }
```

Now another problem arises.
When I implement cons, I have a new `Lst` node.
The `Lst` node contains `Expr` that do have history.
But `Lst` itself doesn't have a history.
What could the history be there?
I wonder if this is a problem.

Now this isn't working but I don't understand the problem.
The problem is that the result isn't right either.
Why isn't the result right?
I'm trying to preserve the original structure _and_ compute the result.
When there are recursive calls to `eval`, then I can't do both.
For example, it seems like I can't implement cons while both preserving and 
folding the structure.

How is `histo` implemented?

Ok what if I do this instead.
I return the fully evaluated thing.

```elm
type Expr 
  = SFrm SFrm (Maybe Histo)
  | Sym String (Maybe Histo)
  | Lst (List Expr) (Maybe Histo)
  | Fn Env (List Expr) Expr (Maybe Histo)

type Histo = 
  Histo { step : Int
        , result : Result EvalErr Expr
        }
```
