- [research] Understand how the y-combinator works
- [project] Rewrite the Guston's `eval` function with recursion schemes
- [project] Show line and column number in Guston runtime errors
- [project] Give the user a way to step through Guston evaluation for debugging
- [project] Write all exercises from _The Little Schemer_ in Guston
- [project] A problem-solving app based on Polya's _How to Solve It_
- [project] A single file system on top of cloud storage services
- [write] "Lisp is like the World of Philip Guston"
- [write] "Recursion is More Substitution than Repetition"
- [problem] Self-taught learners need a way to discover what they don't know 
  they don't know
- [problem] Dad would like a single interface to all of his cloud storage 
  accounts
- [problem] Archiving digital artwork

- [problem] I'm burnt out
- [read] Finish reading _Haskell from First Principles_
- [read] _Thinking With Types_
- [project] A Sourcegraph extension that highlights function scope
- [activity] Attend Monadic party?
- [problem] not enough time
- [problem] unclear what i'm trying to achieve
- [problem] when i write blog posts, i'd like to show the context of a code example
- [problem] when i write blog posts, i'd like to be able to write all of the code examples as a single file, 
  then refer to fragments of that file in the text
- [problem] i'd like the code to be more interactive
- [problem] i'd like my readers to be able to play with the code in the examples
  i'd like a complete runtime within the article, but i don't want the runtime to 
  be capable of something that isn't relevant to the article
- [problem] i'd like a syntax for notes that will
  - automatically generate the anchor tags
  - place the notes at the bottom
  - style the note in a notes markup
  - so i can write the footnote next to the text where i link to it
- [research] what is recursion?
  - the goal is for the reader to understand recursion
  - the goal is to give the reader an intuition for recursion by showing different
    instances of recursion
  - start by showing how data can be recursive
  - then show how to define functions over recursive data
  - then show how patterns are recursive
  - recursive types
      - exercise: implement a tree
      - language would need:
        - ADTs
        - A type system
        - functions
        - pattern matching syntax
        - the only kind of value is an ADT
  - recursive functions
      - exercise: maybe a maze solver?
      - language would need:
        - functions
        - pattern matching
  - recursive patterns
      - implement some kind of parser or regex
  - recursion as substitution
  - advanced topics could include
    - fixed point types
    - recursion schemes
- theses:
  - being able to write and run a program (in the browser) without having to 
    install anything is essential to introducing people to programming 
    - if i hadn't been able to type `console.log("Hello World!")` into a Codecademy
      editor, I really don't know if I would have bothered to try coding.
      I had so much doubt that I was capable of programming. 
      If the bar to entry had been any higher, I would have talked myself out of it.
  - most (all?) programming languages have too much extra going on that beginners
    shouldn't have to know about
  - the focus of learning to program should be about learning concepts and not 
    languages
