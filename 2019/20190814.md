## Notes on the Logo-like language


- `cons` -> `::` -> `box`
- `define` -> `label`
- `car` -> `first`
- `if` -> `if`
- `atom?` -> `atom?`
- `eq?` -> `==`
- `lambda` -> `fn` -> `word` -> `abstraction`
- `quote` -> ?
- `cdr` -> `rest`

```
(word id (x) x)
(word (id x) x)
(:: )
(box x '(y z))
(box 'x 'y)
(pair? x)
```

- `first`
- `rest`
- `label`
- `word`

Use `label` instead of `=`.
Use `put` instead of `cons`?
`do` for sequencing effects will be very nice, makes sense.
`atom?` and `if` make sense.
What is a good name for `fn`?
Maybe I should add a `console.log` operation?

Maybe it would be good to encourage people not to get hung up on names.
You'll understand these things by experiencing their behavior.
Over time, you'll come to associate these symbols with those behaviors.
That is the kind of understanding you want to have - not memorizing names and
descriptions, but associating a symbol with a memory of an experience you had.

> The names `car` and `cdr` persist because simple combinations like `cadr` are
> pronounceable.
