## Recursion explainer

Start with recursive patterns.
Something is recursive when it is defined in terms of itself.
What do I want the reader to be capable of after reading the explainer? 
I'd like the reader to be able to write a grammar for a non-trivial language.
I'd like the reader to be able to describe a pattern that repeats a random
number of times.

How?

- learn through doing
- link to do something in the real world, a motivating, non-trivial example
- see how the steps taken to match the string against the grammar. 
  this was something that confused me when i first learned about formal 
  grammars.

A couple of principles.

Describe this string: `a`.

```
Start = "a"
```

Describe this string: `abc`.

```
Start = "abc"
```

Describe this `a` _and_ `abc`.

```
Start = "a" | "abc"
```

Describe `a` _and_ `aa`.

```
Start = "a" | "aa"
```

Describe `a` _and_ `aa` _and_ `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`.

```
Start = "a" | "aa" | `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
```

Describe `abc` OR `def`.

```
Start = "abc" | "def"
```

Describe `abcdef` or `defabc`.

```
Start = ABC, DEF | DEF, ABC

ABC = "abc"

DEF = "def"
```

Describe `abcdefabcdef`

```
Start = ABC, DEF, ABC, DEF

ABC = "abc"

DEF = "def"
```

Describe `abcdef` or `abcdefabcdef` or `abcdefabcdefabcdef`

```
Pattern = ABCDEF | ABCDEF, ABCDEF | ABCDEF, ABCDEF, ABCDEF

ABCDEF = ABC, DEF

ABC = "abc"

DEF = "def"
```

Describe `abcdef` repeating a random number of times

```
Pattern = ABCDEF | ABCDEF, Pattern

ABCDEF = ABC, DEF

ABC = "abc"

DEF = "def"
```

Need an interface to test if this approach works.
