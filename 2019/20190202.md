Questions

**How should I do exceptions during evaluation?**

Is it better to throw/catch?
Should I return a Result?

**Should cons evaluate its arguments?**

Is it idiomatic Lisp for `cons` to evaluate its arguments?

**What are the semantics of `define`?**

Here is the `define` I have now: `(define key val body)`.
`val` is bound to `key` in the global environment.
Then `body` is evaluated.
That makes this possible:

```lisp
(define foo 'x (define foo 'y (foo)))
```

The above evaluates to `y`.
So it's possible to mutate global variables deep within expressions.
There are two questions I have about this:

- Is this the way Lisp normally works?
- What would the language look like if this wasn't possible?
  - Possible to assign to variables once
  - Cannot assign to global variables during expression evaluation
  - Like Haskell
  - Definitions and expression evaluation don't interact

**What does `cond` return when the list is empty?**

Maybe a better design is this:

```lisp
(cond <condition...> <otherwise>)
```

**How to model lambda functions**
