Today, I am struggling with SICP exercise 1.11.
I'm stuck on the iterative implementation of the function.
The recursive version builds up a chain of deferred computations that are not
evaluated until the chain is completely expanded.
The iterative version should not expand like this.
Instead, it should compute intermediate state and pass it forward via function
parameters, mimicking an imperative loop.

For some reason, I'm having trouble seeing the problem this way.
I'm really stuck on what the underlying formula does.
Like, let's say I have a counter variable.
When do I stop iterating?
In the original function, I stop iterating when `n` is less than 3.
I'm not sure if that's the counter.
I kind of don't think it is.

The other possibility for the counter might be count up to `n` from 0.
Or count down from `n` to 0.
That's how the `factorial` and `fib` examples work - the number of iterations is
equal to the input `n`.

But I'm really stuck on how to modify the state variables.
I don't really know what the pattern is.
It's easier with `factorial` and `fib` because the pattern can be expressed
imperatively.
But I can't express the pattern of this function.
Any expression that wraps some function calls in a `+` expression defers the
evaluation.

Recursion and iteration are both ways to repeat computation.
So, maybe it's a good idea to ask "where is the repeating?"
