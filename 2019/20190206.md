## Wiz status

goal: write a lisp from the bottom up. use that lisp to work through SICP.

mvp:

1. a way to execute programs
  - load file into repl
      - no IO required
      - some kind of load function
  - work directly in the repl
      - no IO required
      -
  - execute file

todo for version 0.1.0

- load a file into a repl
- replace `true` and `false` with `t` and `'()`, to align with McCarthy's 
  original design

- [X] repl
- [X] write the Show instance for Sexpr
- some form of code re-use
  - standard library
  - include another source file
  - module system
- evaluate file
- improve error handling
- compile to JavaScript
- capture common patterns like
  - `null?`
  - `if`
  - `defun`
- evaluate file
  - Then you need some form of input/output
- what about a repl that runs in the browser?
- see what happens if you add a type system
- a better way to model failure states like Either or Maybe
- add numbers and strings
- add syntax sugar for quote
- add a de-sugaring phase to the parser
