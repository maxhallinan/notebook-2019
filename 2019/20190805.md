## Logo interactive notebook

### Notes on the Logo programming language

#### **[Logo Philosophy and Implementation](http://www.microworlds.com/support/logo-philosophy-papert.html)**

Learning by doing is the best way to learn.
Thinking and talking about what has been done makes learning by doing even 
better.

More than a programming language, Logo is about a "certain spirit of doing
things".

The Logo spirit:

- Learn by making.
- No right and wrong answers.
- The goal is to get it (whatever project you're working on) to work.
- A moment when something doesn't work is an opportunity to understand 
  what you are trying to do.
- The teacher and the student work together on a project.
- The teacher works with students on problems that are new to the teacher.
- Build skills that enable the individual to contribute to the construction of 
  new things, not being trapped in dependency on others who have those skills.

Logo is essentially a culture.

Features of the Logo culture:

- Use of the Logo language (though Papert does not feel the language itself is
  essential and could imagine, in principle, using a different language).
- Belief that children can program.
- Belief that children are can do more than is usually believed they can do,
  given tools and opportunity.
- Individual projects are encouraged.
- Contact with powerful ideas is facilitated.
- Teachers should do a lot of learning in the presence of their students.
- Teachers should collaborate with students to solve problems and make things
  that the teacher does not already know how to do.

Technology has two aspects:

- Informational medium 
- Constructional medium

Education has the same dichotomy.

- Informational: getting information about things, e.g. by reading books.
- Constructional: doing things, making things, constructing things.

Technology is not a replacement for the teacher.
Technology is a medium in which the teacher and the student can work together on
projects that apply powerful ideas.

##### Quotes

> The great religious teachers of the world have understood that if you want to
> communicate a powerful idea you may do better by telling stories than by
> spinning abstract definitions.

> &mdash; Seymour Papert

> we learn better by doing ... but we learn better still if we combine our doing
> by talking and thinking about what we have done.
>
> &mdash; Seymour Papert

The combination of doing and thinking about what has been done is one of the
things I find powerful about an interactive notebook.

> what is important to the writers

> A crucial aspect of the Logo spirit is fostering situations which the teacher
> has never seen before and so has to join the students as a co-learner.

> &mdash; Seymour Papert

> In short I like to recognize &mdash; only slightly simplyfing a complex issue
> &mdash; two wings of digital technology: the technology as an informational
> medium and the technology as a constructional medium in which garb it is more
> like wood and bricks and steel than printing or television.

> &mdash; Seymour Papert

> The primary way that digital technology will help us is to provide more
> opportunity for wonderful teachers to work with wonderful students on projects
> where they will jointly exercise wonderfully powerful ideas.

#### ["What is a Logo-Like Language?" by Bryan Harvey](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/elogo.html)

> Our argument was that Logo should have a single, uniform rule for evaluating
> expressions: Every expression consists of the name of a procedure, followed by
> some number of expressions that provide the arguments.

(Lisp)
