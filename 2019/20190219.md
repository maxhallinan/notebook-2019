## [An Introduction to Recursion Schemes](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/)

A basic abstract syntax tree:

```haskell
data Expr
  = Index Expr Expr
  | Call Expr [Expr]
  | Unary String Expr
  | Binary Expr String Expr
  | Paren Expr
  | Literal Lit
  deriving (Show, Eq)
```

The type `Expr` is explicitly recursive.
Any function that traverses `Expr` is forced to handle the recursion explicitly.

Example:

```haskell
-- remove parens
flatten :: Expr -> Expr
flatten (Index e1 e2) = Index (flatten e1) (flatten e2)
flatten (Call e1 es) = Call (flatten e1) (flatten <$> es)
flatten (Unary s e) = Unary s (flatten e)
flatten (Binary e1 s e2) = Binary (flatten e1) s (flatten e2)
flatten (Paren e) = e
flatten (Literal x) = Literal x
```

This function is very big and very noisy just because it needs to handle all the
instances of recursion.

### Parameterizing Our Types

All instances of recursion are replaced with the type parameter `a`.

```haskell
data ExprF a
  = Index a a
  | Call a [a]
  | Unary String a
  | Binary a String a
  | Paren a
  | Literal Lit
  deriving (Show, Eq)
```

`ExprF` makes `Expr` a Functor.

### Fixed Points

> A fixed point of a function is a value that, when applied as the input of the
> function, returns the same value as its output.

> A fixed point of a function `f` is a value that does not change under the
> application of the function `f`.

> `fix`, when applied to an arbitrary function `f`, yields the same result as
> `f` applied to the result of applying `fix` to `f`

The y combinator

```haskell
y = \f -> (\x -> f (x x))(\x -> f (x x))
```

Add a Y combinator to the type system.

```haskell
newtype Term f = In { out :: f (Term f) }
```

```haskell
newtype Term f = In { out :: f (Term f) }

data ExprF a
  = Foo
  | Bar a
  | Baz

type Expr = Term ExprF -- In (ExprF (Term ExprF))
```
