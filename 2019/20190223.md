## Haskell and strictness

## Outside-in versus inside-out evaluation

Strict languages evaluate inside-out.
Inside-out evaluation means that the deepest nodes in the expression tree are
evaluated first.
So, _everything_ is evaluated.
Outside-in means that expression starts at the top of the tree and works its way
down, only evaluating the subexpressions it needs to evaluate the outer 
expression.

### The `seq` function

```haskell
seq :: a -> b -> b 
```

`seq` forces evaluation of `a`, discards it, and evaluates `b`.
Evaluation means that the first argument is forced to weak head normal form.
For data types, weak head normal form means removing the outermost constructor.
But `seq` expression only forces evaluation of `a` if itself is evaluated.
Here `undefined` is not evaluated because `foo True` is not evaluated:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let foo x = seq undefined x
  let bar = foo True
  print "Hello World"
```

But here, `print bar` finally forces evaluation of the seq expression:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let foo x = seq undefined x
  let bar = foo True
  print bar
```

```
-- "foo", "bar", "foobar", "foobarfoobar" "foobarfoobarfoobarfoobar"
Pattern = Foo | Bar | FooBar | Pattern

FooBar = Foo, Bar

Foo = "foo"

Bar = "bar"
```
