## Lisp stepper

Goal: I want to be able to enter an arbitrary Lisp expression into a text field
and press evaluate. 
Then I want to be able to walk through each step the evaluator took.

Approach: turn a Lisp expression tree into a tree that has a pair - 
the original subtree and the result of evaluating the subtree.
I also want to include information about the order that node in the tree was
visited.

Want to turn this:

```
     a
   /   \
  b     c
 / \   / \
d   e f   g
```

into this:

```
           (a', a)
                |
             --- ---
            /       \
      (b', b)       (c', c)
           |             |
        ----              ----
       / \                  / \
(d', d)   (e', e)    (f', f)   (g', g)
```

```elm
type Expr
  = SFrm SFrm
  | Sym String
  | Lst (List Expr)
  | Fn Env (List Expr) Expr
```

```elm
-- input
Lst [ SFrm Quote, Lst []]

-- output
(Ok (Lst []), Lst [ (Ok (SFrm Quote), SFrm Quote)
                  , (Ok (Lst []), Lst [])
                  ])
```

```elm
-- input
Lst [ SFrm Cons
    , Lst [ SFrm Quote, Sym "foo" ]
    , Lst [ SFrm Quote, Lst [] ]
    ]

-- output
( Ok (Lst [Sym "foo"])
, Lst [ (Ok (SFrm Cons), SFrm Cons)
      , (Ok (Sym "foo"), Lst [ (Ok (SFrm Quote), SFrm Quote)
                             , (Ok (Sym "foo"), Sym "foo") 
                             ] )
      , (Ok (Lst []), Lst [ (Ok (SFrm Quote), SFrm Quote)
                          , (Ok (Lst []), Lst []) 
                          ] )
      ]
)
```

The first problem I run into with this is the types.
What is the type of the output expression?
You can't construct a this value

```elm
Lst [(Ok (SFrm Quote), SFrm Quote), (Ok (Lst []), Lst [])]`
```

because the second item in the tuple is invalid.

```elm
Lst (Result a Expr, ?)
```

You can't construct a `Lst` value with anything other than a `List Expr`.
I'm trying to construct the `Lst` with this pair instead.
But I also don't want to duplicate the data constructors for the Lisp AST.
I could parameterize them:

```elm
type ExprF a =
  = SFrm SFrm
  | Sym String
  | Lst (List a)
  | Fn Env (List a) a

type Expr = Expr (ExprF Expr)

type ExprEval = ExprEval Eval (ExprF ExprEval)

type Eval = Result EvalErr Expr
```

```elm
Expr (Lst [ Expr (SFrm Quote)
          , Expr (Lst [])
          ])
```

```elm
ExprEval 
  (Ok (Expr (Lst [])))
  (Lst [ ExprEval (Ok (Expr (SFrm Quote))) (SFrm Quote) 
       , ExprEval (Ok (Expr (Lst []))) (Lst [])
       ])
```

```elm
-- input
Expr (Lst [ Expr (SFrm Cons)
          , Expr (Expr (Lst [ Expr (SFrm Quote)
                            , Expr (Sym "foo")
                            ]))
          , Expr (Expr (Lst [ Expr (SFrm Quote)
                            , Expr (Lst [])
                            ]))
          ])

-- output
ExprEval
  (Ok (Expr (Lst [ Expr (Sym "foo")])))
  (Lst [ ExprEval 
          (Ok (Expr (Sym "foo"))) 
          (Lst [ ExprEval 
                  (Ok (Expr (SFrm Quote))) 
                  (SFrm Quote)
               , ExprEval 
                  (Ok (Expr (Sym "foo"))) 
                  (Sym "foo")
               ])
       , ExprEval 
          (Ok (Expr (List []))) 
          (Lst [ ExprEval 
                  (Ok (Expr (SFrm Quote))) 
                  (SFrm Quote)
               , ExprEval 
                  (Ok (Expr (Lst []))) 
                  (Lst [])
               ])
       ])
```

Now I run into another problem in the implementation of `evalQuote`:

```elm
evalQuote : State -> List Expr -> ( Histo, State )
evalQuote state args =
    case args of
        [ e ] ->
            ( Histo (Ok e)
                (Lst
                    [ Histo (Ok (Expr (SFrm Quote))) (SFrm Quote)
                    , Histo (Ok e) () -- I have to put something here
                    ]
                )
            , state
            )

        _ ->
            ( Histo (Err NumArgs) (), state )
```

What is the problem?
The problem is that when I evaluate the `Quote` expression, I have to give the
`Histo` a `ExprF Histo` value.
Why is that a problem?
`Histo` is produced by `eval`.
But that quoted sub-expression hasn't been eval-ed yet.
What is it's `Histo` then?

Maybe the problem is that I'm using top-down recursion instead of bottom-up.
A histomorphism is kind of what I'm looking for.
How do I apply this to the problem I'm working on?

```purescript
type CVAlgebra f a = f (Attr f a) -> a

histo' :: forall f a. Functor f => CVAlgebra f a -> Fix f -> a
histo' f = worker >>> getAttribute
  where
    worker = unwrap >>> map (\x -> worker x) >>> mkAttr
    mkAttr term = Attr { attribute: f term
                       , hole: term
                       }
    getAttribute = unwrap >>> _.attribute`
```
