## Functions that behave like data

Imagine we have a programming language that only has functions and atoms.
Here is the identity function:

```
(fn (x) x)
```

One assumption here is that all of our interaction with data is mediated by 
functions.
Instead of some syntax like `var foo = { bar: 1 }` to construct some data and
`foo.bar = 2` to set some data, we use functions like `(label 'foo (object 'bar 1))` and 
`(get 'bar foo)`.

### Functions that behave like numbers

```
```

### Functions that behave like lists

## Functions that behave like objects
