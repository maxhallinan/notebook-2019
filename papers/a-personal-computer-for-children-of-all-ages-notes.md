# Notes on "A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages" by Alan Kay

A discussion about ways that learning can be augmented with technology.

A primary concern of a child is acquiring a practical model of her environment.
Practical means that it is not necessarily logical or internally consistent.
Kay wants to connect with the child's model rather than simply impose a 
completely different model.
Technology is not necessary to do this; technology is just a medium.
Technology, like any other medium, can't "save the world".
It can be used for good or for evil, and brings both new solutions to old 
problems and new problems.
